    <h3>Project 1: Earthquake Analysis</h3>
    
    <p>This project focuses on analyzing global earthquake patterns over the past month, examining frequency, magnitude, and geographical distribution.</p>
    
    <p>By applying various data visualization tools, I discovered that Canada is a region with the most earthquakes, but the magnitude of these earthquakes is typically less than 2.</p>
    
    <h4>Earthquake Frequency by Magnitude Range</h4>
    <p>The diagram below shows the distribution of earthquake frequency across different magnitude ranges:</p>

    <h4>Top 10 Regions by Number of Earthquakes</h4>
    <p>The following graph illustrates the top 10 regions based on the number of earthquakes:</p>

    <h4>Correlation of Earthquake Features</h4>
    <p>Earthquakes have four main features: Magnitude, Longitude, Latitude, and Depth. The image below shows the correlation between these features. Notably, Longitude, Magnitude, and Depth exhibit stronger correlations.</p>
